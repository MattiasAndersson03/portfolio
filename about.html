    About Me
  </h2>
<p class="about-me">
  I’m Mattias Andersson – a curious and motivated DevOps Engineer in the making. 
  I chose DevOps because it’s a relatively new and evolving field compared to traditional software development. 
  What excites me most is the constant exploration of new tools and approaches that can make systems smarter, faster, and more resilient.
</p>

<p class="about-me">
  My favorite part of DevOps is automation. There’s something deeply satisfying about transforming a manual, 
  repetitive task into a fully automated process. CI/CD pipelines in particular have become an area where I not only 
  feel confident but also genuinely enjoy experimenting and improving workflows. Seeing code go from commit to deployment without 
  friction is both rewarding and motivating.
</p>

<p class="about-me">
  I’ve had the opportunity to experience both small startups and larger companies, and the difference is eye-opening. 
  In smaller companies, development moves quickly and decisions have immediate impact, while larger organizations bring complexity, 
  scale, and processes that require a different mindset. Both environments have taught me valuable lessons, and I see myself thriving 
  in either – though startups often spark my curiosity the most.
</p>

<p class="about-me">
  One project I’m especially proud of was during an internship, where I built a CI/CD pipeline that automatically created and configured a 
  VM running Dagster. The setup ensured that all data was stored safely in a database, making recovery fast and reliable in case the VM went down. 
  It was a perfect example of why I love DevOps: solving real problems with efficient, automated solutions.
</p>

<p class="about-me">
  Beyond tech, I enjoy playing games, working on side projects, and even setting up personal infrastructure just for fun 
  – like building a fully automated Minecraft server with Docker. My friends would describe me as helpful, curious, and always willing 
  to dive into new challenges. At the core, problem-solving and curiosity are what drive me, both in technology and in life.
